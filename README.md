# Find e to the Nth Digit.
Two python program to find e to the Nth digit.
One with GUI (Tkinter), another - simple one (similar to Find PI to the Nth digit.

## What it could do?
Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places.

Limit is 1000 decimal places.

## Technologies
Project is created with:

* Editor: Visual Studio Code 1.71.2
* Program language: Python 3.10

## How it works?
#### Project contains 2 functions and while statement, which is asking for continue after each generated PI.

Also, Decimal module used to provide support for fast correctly rounded decimal floating-point arithmetic.

* First function used [Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) to find PI.

Decimal class and getcontext() helped to get more accurate PI. 

* Second function used to ask User for number of decimal places, which PI will be generated.

try/except helped to avoid input errors.

* While statement after every generated PI will ask User for continue.

PI number present as string object, which sliced to asked decimal places.

## Is PI number generated by program correctly?
